<strong>Lessons from Day 10</strong>:
<li>
<strong>let var</strong> - another type of variable in JavaScript. <em>Variables declared by let have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks . In this way, let works very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function</em>&mdash;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" target="_blank" title="MDN link">MDN link</a>
</li>
	<li><strong>inBetween = !inBetween</strong> is  same as <strong>inbetween = true</strong>. It's also called a <strong>flag variable</strong> - <em><a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/valid2.shtml" target="_blank">a flag variable, in its simplest form, is a variable you define to have one value until some condition is true, in which case you change the variable's value</a></em>.

<strong>Warning&dash;change vs click</strong>
I started it by myself and in this point - it didn't react anyhow. 
<pre>
if(e.shiftKey && this.checked){
	console.log("jep");
}

</pre>
 
As I listened to the 'change', I changed it to 'click' and voila - it worked.
